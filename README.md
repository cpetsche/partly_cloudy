Aircraft have a two-fold impact on climate change in that they create contrails or Aircraft-Induced Clouds (AICs) that block heat from being released into space whilst releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Heat is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, causing a warming effect known as global warming. AICs are formed when an aircraft flies through certain atmospheric conditions, known as Ice Supersaturated Regions (ISSRs). The formation of AICs could be lessened if flight planners and operators were able to predict when and where ISSRs would occur. This information would then be used to construct new flight paths that would avoid those areas. The objective of this project is to assist the aviation industry in reducing its contribution to global warming by predicting the presence of ISSRs and the areas in which AICs are most likely to form within the contiguous United States (CONUS).  Three datasets were utilized for this project: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Rapid Refresh (RAP), Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), and Air Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) Boundaries. Machine learning methodologies were utilized in developing and implementing predictive models. Predictions were separated by the ARTCC in which they occur and combined into 6-hour increments. Our findings include visualizations of ISSRs, flight patterns, and flights traversing ISSR locations. 

This project was completed in partnership with Dr. Lance Sherry, from the George Mason University Center for Air Transportation Systems Research (CATSR), and Mr. Yuan Ho, a software developer from Unidata.
