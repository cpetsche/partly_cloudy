## Forecasting Aircraft Induced Clouds (AIC) Hot Spots <img src= "https://github.com/rina635/partly_cloudy/blob/main/images/2601_cloud.png">

Partly Cloudy is comprised of 5 Data Analytical Engineering students at GMU, this our Captone Project. Over the course of 12-weeks we've worked alongside George Mason's Center for Airport Transportation Systems Research (CASTR).

Aviation contributes approximately 4% of anthropogenic global warmining and the effects are immediate compared to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
- 60% of that is attributed to Aircraft Induced Clouds (AICs) or contrails.
- 40% comes from their fuel emissions.

### Where does that 60% come from?

- AICs form as a result of aircraft emissions (water vapor and soot) passing through **Ice Super Saturdated Regions (ISSRs)** where humidity is 100% and ≤ -60 ℃. These emissions create crysallized ice clouds.
- AICs trap and reflect 33% of Earth's thermal radiation back into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that causes the atmosphere to heat up.

### What is Partly Cloudy doing about it?

The objective of this project is to assist the aviation industry in reducing its contribution to global warming by predicting the presence of ISSRs and the areas in which **AICs** are most likely to form within the **Contiguous United States (CONUS)**.  We will also analyze flight data, so that we can forecast where aircraft are most likely to traverse through the predicted **ISSRs**, to identify these hot spots.
