    <h2>THE MODEL</h2>
    <p>For the purpose of modeling, we chose 4 ARTCC to model: Washington, D.C., Jacksonville, FL, Miami, FL, and Seattle, Washington.
        You can learn more about why we chose those 4 from our <a href="findings.html"><strong>findings.</strong></a>    
    We then gathered data for only the 6-hour time periods of the day: 0600, 1200, 1800, and 2400. This included cell location (nx, ny),
    the ISSR count at the cell location, average temperature, and average relative humdiity over ice. </p>
    <p>We attempted 2 different time series models: LSTM and XGBoost</p>
    <h3>1. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)</h3>
    <p>The initial approach of LSTM was to design two different models for each ARTCC were created to represent two flight level ranges:
        FL 200-430 and FL 300-370.</p>

            </div>
        </div>        
    <p>Despite the two different flight windows, the model's results remained fairly uniform. It was apparent that the model was unable to
        learn the nuances of our data. For a 4-day date range in Miami from May 11th 2021-May 15th 2020 the predictive ISSR counts were 55-58
        for the 1st model with the flight level range 200-430.
        The 2nd model where the flight level range was 300-370, LSTM's predictions stayed around 25-28.
    </p>
    <h3>2. XGBoost</h3>
    <p> XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. It could be used on a wide range of applications. XGBoost has a great combination of prediction performance and processing time compared to other algorithms.
    
    For XGBoost, we decided to use the flight level ranges 300-340. By implementing this new range, we were no longer excluding data anomalies and this larger range compared to FL 300-370 allowed for more variance.
    In order to predict the volume of ISSR, we uses 1 month and 3 month periods as the training window and to predict the ISSR Count of the following full day. For example, in Miami ARTCC center, we randomly select a date, September 5th, and use a one-month window, which is from Aug 5 to Sep 5, as the training dataset, and to predict the ISSR count from Sep 5 midnight to Sep 6 midnight. We also use the 3-month window, which is from Jun 5 to Sep 5, as the training set, and to predict the following full day.â€‹</p>

    <p>When training our model, instead of manually tuning the model, we used random search from scikitlearn package. Random search uses a large range of hyperparameters values, and randomly iterates a specified number of times over combinations of those values. In our project, we iterate 25 times considering runtime and quality of the performance.
